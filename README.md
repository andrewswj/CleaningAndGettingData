# README.MD
This repository holds all my files for the Coursera Week 4 Cleaning and Getting Data peer-reviewed assignment. 

This repository contains 4 files: README.md, tidydata.txt, run_analysis.R and a code book.

The code book contains information about the raw data, the data processing and instructions for running the code. The code may be found in run_analysis.R if you wish to view the data processing steps. 

tidydata.txt contains the output of the data processing.

Note that the original raw data is not supplied here. A link to download the raw data can be found from the code book.
